## About cost effective resources
Using the appropriate services, instances and resources for your workload is key to cost savings. A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact. You also have the opportunity to use managed services to reduce costs.
AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs.
