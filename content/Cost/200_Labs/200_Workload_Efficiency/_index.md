## Introduction
This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to measure the efficiency of a workload. It shows you how to get the overall efficiency, then look deeper for patterns in usage to be able to allocate different weights to different outputs of a system.

The lab uses a simple web application to demonstrate the efficiency, but will teach you the techniques so that it can be applied to **ANY** workload you have, whether its born in the cloud or legacy.

The first time you perform this lab it is recommended to use the sample files supplied, then you can use your own application and billing files for each workload you have.
