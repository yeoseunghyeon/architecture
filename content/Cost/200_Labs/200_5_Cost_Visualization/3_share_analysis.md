Now that your QuickSight Analysis is complete, it is time to share the Analysis or publish a Dashboard. An Analysis is a read and write copy of the Visuals and Data Set that you created. A dashboard is a read-only version, allowing the user to apply filters but not make any changes to the Visuals or Data Set.

### Share an analysis
1. To share an analysis, click on **Share** on the top right, then select **Share analysis**:
