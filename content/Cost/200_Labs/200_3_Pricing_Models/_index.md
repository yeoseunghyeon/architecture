## Introduction
Commitment discounts offer lower prices when you make a commitment to a minimum amount of usage. Reserved Instances (RI's) are available for RDS, RedShift, DynamoDB, Elasticache, and Elasticsearch (For EC2 - Savings Plans should be purchased). This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to perform a Reserved Instance analysis, and make low risk, high return RI purchases at scale. The skills you learn will help you ensure your workloads utilize different pricing models in alignment with the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
