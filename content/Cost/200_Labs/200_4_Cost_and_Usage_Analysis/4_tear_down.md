Amazon Athena only charges when it is being used, i.e. data is being scanned - so if it is not being actively queried, there are no charges. There may be some charges from AWS Glue if it is above the free tier limit.

As it is best practice to regularly analyze your usage and cost, so there is no teardown for this lab.
