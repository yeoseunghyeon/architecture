Enabling AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags, generates a cost allocation tag containing resource creator information. This is automatically applied to resources that are created, and allows you to view and allocate costs based on who created a resource.

1. Log in to your **Master account** as an IAM user with the required permissions, and go to the **Billing** console:
