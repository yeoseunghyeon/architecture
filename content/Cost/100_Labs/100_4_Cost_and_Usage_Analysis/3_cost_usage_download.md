5. It will download a CSV version of the bill you can use in a spreadsheet application. It is recommended to NOT use this data source for calculations and analysis, instead you should use the Cost and Usage Report, which is covered in [200_4_Cost_and_Usage_Analysis]({{< ref "/Cost/200_Labs/200_4_Cost_and_Usage_Analysis" >}}).
