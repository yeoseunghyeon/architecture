## Introduction
Savings Plans are a commitment based discount model. By making a commitment of spend you will use for 1 or 3 years, you receive a discount of up to 72%. They offer the same discounts as Reserved Instances, however offer a great deal more flexibility, and do not have the same management overhead.

In this workshop we will take you through your recommendations, and help you choose the right savings plan for your future business requirements.

9. This will typically be the highest and lowest savings you can achieve on the previous usage that was analyzed. You can vary those options to achieve the discount and features that most suit your business. You can also combine the options by purchasing multiple savings plans, making some commitment for 1-year with an upfront component, and some with no upfront commitment for a 3-year term.

While the commitment is a full 1 or 3 years, a Savings Plan will typically be paid off much sooner. We will analyze this in the next step.
