In large organizations usage can be distributed across many teams, and could take significant effort to collect. We can assist this effort by using tooling to understand your overall trends in usage to make an informed choice on Savings Plan commitments.

You can use the **Compute Savings Plan** for this exercise if you plan on purchasing a compute plan. However we will use an **EC2 Instance** plan to provide more granularity and insights into usage.

1. Click on **Recommendations** and then select **EC2 Instance** Savings Plans type, **1-year** Savings Plans term, **All upfront**, and **60 days** time period:

7. Compare the trends in usage to see if your usage is increasing or decreasing. If usage is decreasing make a smaller initial hourly commitment, then re-analyze in 2-4 weeks. If usage is steady or increasing make a commitment closer to the recommended commitment:

You now have an understanding of your overall usage trend, and can use this information to make a commitment that is matched to your business requirements.
