The following instructions will remove the resources that you have created in this lab.

If you deployed the CloudFormation stacks as part of the prerequisites for this lab, then delete these stacks to remove all the AWS resources. If you need help with how to delete CloudFormation stacks then follow these instructions to tear down those resources:
* [Delete the WebApp resources]({{< ref "/Security/200_Labs/200_Automated_Deployment_of_EC2_Web_Application/2_cleanup" >}})
* Wait for this stack deletion to complete
* [Delete the VPC resources]({{< ref "/Security/200_Labs/200_Automated_Deployment_of_VPC/2_cleanup" >}})


Otherwise, there were no additional new resources added as part of this lab.
