## Introduction

This hands-on lab will guide you through how to use AWS CloudFormation to automatically configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Groups and roles for cross-account access.
You will use the AWS Management Console and AWS CloudFormation to guide you through how to automate the configuration of a new or existing AWS account with IAM best practices. The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Goals

* Fine-grained authorization
* Automate security best practices

## Prerequisites

* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes.
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
