# {#best_practices}
The security best practices followed in this lab are:

* [Manage credentials and authentication](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SEC_1.en.html) Use of MFA for access to provide additional access control.
* [Grant access through roles or federation:](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SEC_3.en.html) Roles with associated policies have been used to define appropriate permission boundaries.
* [Grant least privileges:](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.SEC_3.en.html) The roles are scoped with minimum privileges to accomplish the task.
