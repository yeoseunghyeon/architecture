This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to protect a workload from network based attacks using Amazon CloudFront and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF).
You will use the AWS Management Console and AWS CloudFormation to guide you through how to deploy CloudFront with WAF integration to apply defense in depth methods.
As CloudFront takes some time to update configuration in all edge locations, consider starting step 4 while its deploying.
