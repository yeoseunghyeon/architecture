## Introduction

This hands-on lab will guide you through the introductory steps to configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
You will use the AWS Management Console to guide you through how to configure your first IAM user, group and role for administrative access. The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

{{% notice note %}}
It is highly recommended you centralize your identities instead of using IAM Users and Groups as outlined in this lab. If you have more than a simple AWS test account, use [AWS Single Sign-On](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).
